# Project-TextCrypt
TextCrypt is a program used to encipher and decipher text by an algorithm created by Huan Pham. This kind of cipher is based on Caesar Cipher, and of course it was improved a little bit. Additionally, SHA512 is integrated and used to hide the password. I want to thank Oliver Gay for his implementation of SHA512.
